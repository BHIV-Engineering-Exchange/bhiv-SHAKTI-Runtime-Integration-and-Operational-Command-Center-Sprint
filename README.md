# SHAKTI Executive Dashboard Capability

A production-grade, highly resilient, and configuration-driven React dashboard capability designed for government enterprise and high-stakes operations.

## Overview
This is **NOT** a bespoke dashboard. This is a reusable, composable dashboard *capability* powered by a robust configuration schema (`DashboardProvider.tsx`). It provides 19 standardized `Layouts` and 16 reusable `Primitives`, allowing rapid assembly of diverse command center interfaces without touching backend services.

## Core Tenets
- **Configuration-Driven:** Layout visibility and structural spans are controlled via the central `DashboardProvider` which supports 19 configurable grid zones.
- **Graceful Degradation:** The frontend will never crash if the backend fails. Caching, retries, and offline banners ensure maximum data retention during outages.
- **Strict Architecture:** Adheres to a strict `Primitive -> Layout -> Grid` pattern.
- **Performance First:** Aggressive use of `React.lazy`, `<Suspense>`, and `useMemo` ensures lightning-fast renders.

## Features
- **19 Assembled Layouts:** Executive, Operations, Integrations, Evidence, Observability, Workflow, Operator Console, Runtime Health, Replay, plus BHEX operational surfaces (Repository, Build, Migration, Review, Capability Registries, Employee Execution, Engineering Capacity, Delivery Intelligence, Capability Dependency Graph).
- **Resilience:** Global Error Boundaries, Exponential API Backoff, and custom request timeouts per backend service.
- **Accessibility:** ARIA-live announcements for background updates and focus management.
- **Responsive:** Built on Tailwind CSS Grid, adapting elegantly from mobile to 4K displays.

## Stack
- **React 19**
- **TypeScript 6**
- **Vite 8**
- **Tailwind CSS v4**
- **TanStack Query (React Query v5)**
